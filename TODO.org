** TODO Verify every stipend before showing on public page
   This verification should show every other stipend that the same user has
   added if they are anon, for our (basic) dup detection.
** TODO Improve verification UI 
   right now using only saw_document, so completely ignoring supporting
   documents, whether this was done by an organizer, etc. Probably we should try
   to surface some of this subtlety, but at the very least, we shouldn't ignore
   it altogether.
** DONE Improve amount UI
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 12:14]
   Right now, it just prints what they put in, ignoring the summer question, or
   if they gave us non-yearly amounts. For example, if they gave us yearly but
   they said summer wasn't typical, we should show the 9 month adjusted
   amount (with some note about the total), as that is the more accurate amount).
** TODO Validate file types
   Right now it says to only upload certain types, but we'll take anything.
   Since we only set the Content-Type on those file types, we should really
   reject other stuff, since otherwise viewing the files will be hard
** TODO Set file size limits
   Probably this is important :)
