** DONE Verify every stipend before showing on public page
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 16:26]
   This verification should show every other stipend that the same user has
   added if they are anon, for our (basic) dup detection.
** DONE Improve verification UI 
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 15:22]
   right now using only saw_document, so completely ignoring supporting
   documents, whether this was done by an organizer, etc. Probably we should try
   to surface some of this subtlety, but at the very least, we shouldn't ignore
   it altogether.
** DONE Improve amount UI
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 12:14]
   Right now, it just prints what they put in, ignoring the summer question, or
   if they gave us non-yearly amounts. For example, if they gave us yearly but
   they said summer wasn't typical, we should show the 9 month adjusted
   amount (with some note about the total), as that is the more accurate amount).
** TODO Validate file types
   Right now it says to only upload certain types, but we'll take anything.
   Since we only set the Content-Type on those file types, we should really
   reject other stuff, since otherwise viewing the files will be hard
** TODO Set file size limits
   Probably this is important :)
** DONE Show logged in organizer names somewhere on the page
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 15:34]
   This way, they know they are logged in. :)
** DONE Curators should be able to delete or unverify stipends
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 16:43]
** DONE Show time that stipends are submitted
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 17:44]
** DONE When deleting, don't try to make API call if no documents
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 17:44]
** DONE Show length of time that stipend is for on front.
   CLOSED: [2018-03-19 Mon 21:44]
** TODO Email when new stipends come in
   At least at the beginning (and maybe always), we'll want to be approving
   stuff as soon as possible, and notifying is cheap & easy.
** DONE Add some automated tests
   CLOSED: [2018-03-21 Wed 18:36]
** DONE Add footer w/ open source link
   CLOSED: [2018-03-22 Thu 16:36]
** DONE Longer RSA keys (512bit too weak)
   CLOSED: [2018-03-21 Wed 21:55]
   Note that the AES keys are plenty strong enough (256bit), so what I need to
   do is re-encrypt them with a new, longer, RSA key and replace what's in the
   database (what's in S3 need not change).
** DONE Add CI for test suite
   CLOSED: [2018-03-22 Thu 14:33]
** TODO Curators should be able to easily correct data
** DONE Don't collapse form if there is a submission error!
   CLOSED: [2018-03-24 Sat 14:21]
** TODO Curators should be able to click on stipends to get to the page where all info is shown
   This way they can easily get to supporting documents, etc
** TODO Organizers should be able to get to their uploaded stipends
** DONE Force HTTPS
