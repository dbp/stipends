** TODO Verify every stipend before showing on public page
   This verification should show every other stipend that the same user has
   added if they are anon, for our (basic) dup detection.
** TODO Improve verification UI 
   right now using only saw_document, so completely ignoring supporting
   documents, whether this was done by an organizer, etc. Probably we should try
   to surface some of this subtlety, but at the very least, we shouldn't ignore
   it altogether.
** TODO Improve amount UI
   Right now, it just prints what they put in, ignoring the summer question, or
   if they gave us non-yearly amounts. For example, if they gave us yearly but
   they said summer wasn't guaranteed, we should show the 9 month adjusted
   amount (with some note about the total), as that is the more accurate amount).
