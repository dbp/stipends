  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <h3>How to submit a stipend</h3>
  There are two ways that stipends are added to the site:

  <ol>
    <li>People submit information anonymously (about their own stipends or someone elses).</li>
    <li>Northeastern grads involved organizing with GENU-UAW enter in stipend information they've collected.</li>
  </ol>

  In the first case, the information is reviewed by one of the site <a href="/who">curators</a> before
  being posted publicly. This is to ensure that information that doesn't make sense doesn't end up on the public site. In the second case, since the information is being entered not by anonymous people but by known individuals (and the data is tied to them),
  the data is immediately published. If it turns out to be innaccurate, it can
  of course be corrected. 

  <h3>What about "supporting documents?"</h3>

  It's really important that the information be accurate. The best way to do
  that is to have the stipend information be submitted along with an offer
  letter that describes the stipend that you get (this may be a yearly amount,
  an amount for two semesters, an amount for a single semester). We take your
  privacy very seriously, so any supporting documents you submit are encrypted
  such that only one of the site <a href="/who">curators</a> can read them (not
  only will they never be made public, even if the servers where this site is
  hosted were made public, the letters would not be revealed). 

  <h3>What are the "trusted" bubbles about?</h3>

  Since the information on the site comes from different sources (some
  self-reported, some provided anonymously, some by trusted organizers, etc),
  we want to both give the most complete picture possible (so include as much data as we can) but
  also be realistic about how much we trust a given reported stipend. The more
  bubbles that are filled in, the higher confidence we have that the stipend is
  accurate. Just because there aren't many (or even any) bubbles filled in
  doesn't mean that the stipend isn't accurate, it just means we aren't as sure
  about it.
