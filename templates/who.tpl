  <h2>Who we are: the site curators</h2>

  This site is currently run by the following curators. These are the people who
  review information to post publically and are the only people who can access
  supporting documents that are uploaded along with stipends. The set of
  curators can change over time, but it will always be updated here. We're also
  responsible for keeping the site running, and along with others, making
  changes, improvements, etc.

  <h3 class="curator"><img src="/static/img/dbp.jpg"/> Daniel Patterson <span>is a second year PhD student in the Computer Science department and part of the Organizing Committee with GENU-UAW. He thinks Northeastern grads deserve to be treated better than they are, and that a union is the best way to deal with abusive PIs, win better healthcare for dependents, better childcare options, summer funding for all grads, and more flexible visa options for international students. </h3>
